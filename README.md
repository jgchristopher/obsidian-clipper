# Obsidian Clipper

##**Notice:** 
**Please reinstall the BookMarketlet** link found in the plugin settings. Significant changes were made to this plugin and the updated bookmarklet takes advantage of these changes.


This plugin allows you to capture highlights from the web as Markdown entries in Obsidian.

## Requirements

Obsidian Clipper can be configured to write to either a daily note, weekly note, or both. I have plans to allow other locations.

If you have the [Advanced Tables]() plugin installed, then HTML tables should be captured as markdown tables.

## Prior Work and Inspiration

I originally got this idea from modifying the Gist found in this [Obisdian Forum post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-web-clipper-bookmarklet-with-full-markdown-support-for-images-headings-and-code-blocks/22068).

I used the following Obsidian Plugin repos as examples of how to accomplish my goal.

-   [Obsidian Advanced URI](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri)
-   [Obisidan Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes)
-   [Turndown Ext](https://github.com/jtreml/turndown) to manage HTML tables

#### Dependencies used in development

-   [Obsidian Periodic Note Interface](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-daily-notes-interface)
-   [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown) is used in the bookmarklet code to parse highlighted HTML and convert it to Markdown

If you like the plugin and would want to support its development?
